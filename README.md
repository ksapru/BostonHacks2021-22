## What is currently working:

- Working python code that takes realtime voice input and then outputs a sentiment score.
- Working front-end that takes an audio stream and displays it on the screen 


## What needs to be done:

- Need to connect real time audio stream from our front end to our sentiment api 
- Need to complete front end functionaliy, like giving the user access to their history
